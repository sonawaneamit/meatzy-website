<!-- MEATZY Custom Thank You Page Redirect Script -->
<!-- Add this to: Shopify Admin → Settings → Checkout → Additional scripts -->



<!--
  IMPORTANT NOTES:

  1. This script will redirect customers to your custom thank you page
  2. The 2-second delay allows Shopify to track the conversion
  3. The script is wrapped in try-catch to prevent breaking Shopify's page
  4. All customer data is URL-encoded for safety
  5. The page will work even if redirect fails

  TO ENABLE DEBUG MODE:
  - Change "debug: false" to "debug: true" in the config
  - Open browser console to see logs
  - Remember to turn off before going live!

  TO CHANGE REDIRECT URL:
  - Update "redirectUrl" in config
  - For local testing: 'http://localhost:3000/thank-you'
  - For production: 'https://getmeatzy.com/thank-you'

  TO ADJUST DELAY:
  - Change "delay" value (in milliseconds)
  - 0 = instant, 2000 = 2 seconds, 5000 = 5 seconds
